## Smart Order Router (SOR)

Smart Order Router, or SOR, is an off-chain optimization of routing orders across pools for best price execution.

SOR exists in the Bronze release as a way to aggregate liquidity across all Balancer pools. Future releases of Balancer will accomplish this on-chain and allow aggregate contract fillable liquidity.

Liquidity aggregators are free to use the SOR npm package or create their own order routing across pools.
